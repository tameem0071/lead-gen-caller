I want to upgrade my AI voice caller to sound ultra-realistic — like a real human sales consultant that you cannot tell is AI.

Here’s exactly what I need you to build and optimize step by step:

1. **Voice system**
   - Integrate ElevenLabs’ new Realtime Voice API for generating the caller’s audio stream.  
   - Use the “Brian” or “Josh” voice model with a deeper, calm tone.  
   - Add natural speech pacing and breathing using SSML `<prosody>` and `<break>` tags.  
   - Keep voice settings roughly:  
     - stability: 0.65  
     - similarity_boost: 0.9  
     - style: 0.35  
     - clarity: 0.85  
   - Audio format: `ulaw` (8kHz mono) for Twilio compatibility.  

2. **Twilio integration**
   - Continue to use Twilio for outbound calls.  
   - In the `client.calls.create` call, replace the static TwiML URL with a live WebSocket stream that connects to our ElevenLabs Realtime API.  
   - Twilio should send inbound speech via WebSocket, and the AI should respond dynamically via ElevenLabs audio stream.  
   - If that’s not possible directly, use a webhook (`/voice/realtime`) that accepts Twilio’s webhook events, processes them through GPT + ElevenLabs, and responds with `<Play>` of the new generated audio.  

3. **Conversational intelligence**
   - Replace scripted lines with GPT-4 or GPT-4o-mini response generation.  
   - The caller should sound like a calm, knowledgeable salesman — not pushy or robotic.  
   - Give him a personality like this:
     ```
     You are “Alex,” a calm, professional male with a deep, clear voice.
     You sound intelligent and thoughtful — like a business consultant, not a telemarketer.
     You listen carefully, pause naturally, and answer briefly before waiting for the other person.
     You never sound overly cheerful or fake; your tone is confident and warm.
     You can detect when someone is uninterested and politely wrap up.
     ```
   - Limit responses to 1–2 natural sentences each time.  
   - Always allow interruptions (“barge-in”) using Twilio `<Gather input="speech" bargeIn="true">`.  

4. **Speech recognition**
   - Use Twilio’s built-in speech recognition with language `"en-US"` or `"en-GB"`.  
   - Send recognized speech text to GPT-4 for intent detection (`interested`, `not interested`, `busy`, `questions`, etc.)  
   - Return appropriate replies dynamically — no static scripts.  

5. **Response generation**
   - Use GPT-4 to generate natural replies in real time, then convert them to speech through ElevenLabs before responding via Twilio.  
   - The reply pipeline:
     - User speaks → Twilio webhook receives → send to GPT → generate text → ElevenLabs → return TwiML `<Play>` URL.  

6. **Tone & realism**
   - Lower speech speed (`<prosody rate="93%">`), deepen pitch slightly (`pitch="-3%"`).
   - Add light pauses between phrases (`<break time="0.4s"/>`) for breathing.
   - Occasionally insert small affirmations: “Right.”, “Sure thing.”, “I see.” for realism.
   - No robotic transitions; vary phrasing slightly every call.

7. **Testing**
   - Add a `/simulate` endpoint to test local interactions with a sample phone number (like the one already used in your code).  
   - Once it’s live, place a test call and confirm:
     - Deeper, calm voice (no excitement).
     - Replies feel natural and flow like a real human.
     - Speech overlaps possible (barge-in works).

8. **Secrets (Replit)**
   - TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID  
   - TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN  
   - TWILIO_NUMBER  
   - ELEVENLABS_API_KEY  
   - OPENAI_API_KEY  
   - PUBLIC_BASE_URL (Replit app URL)

This system should combine Twilio for telephony, GPT-4 for dialogue logic, and ElevenLabs Realtime for high-quality voice streaming — producing a smooth, humanlike AI caller indistinguishable from a real person.
