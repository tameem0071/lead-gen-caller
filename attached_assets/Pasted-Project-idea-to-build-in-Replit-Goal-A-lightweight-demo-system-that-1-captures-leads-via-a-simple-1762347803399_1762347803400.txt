Project idea to build in Replit
Goal: A lightweight demo system that (1) captures leads via a simple lead-gen bot and (2) runs an AI-assisted outbound caller that uses Twilio to place short, friendly intro calls to those leads. Keep it minimal, production-ready enough to extend.
Components (minimal)


Lead Gen Bot (web)


Small chat-style widget/page that asks: business name, contact person (optional), phone number, product category, brand name.


Validates phone number and stores a lead.


After submit, shows “We’ll call you shortly” and triggers the call workflow.




Caller Backend (API)


In-memory (or simple DB) “call session” store.


Endpoints:


POST /leads → create lead (from the bot). Returns leadId.


POST /call/start → body: { leadId, phoneNumber, businessName, productCategory, brandName }. Creates a call session and returns { callId, state }.


GET /call/:id/status → returns { callId, state, phoneNumber, transcript, captured }.


GET /calls → list recent sessions (for debugging).


POST /call/:callId/dial → uses Twilio to place the call for that session, returns Twilio call info.






Dialer (Twilio integration)


Uses Twilio Programmable Voice to call session.phoneNumber from a configured Twilio number.


Plays a short TwiML script like:


Intro (“Hi, this is <brand> reaching out about <product category>.”)


One-line pitch


Clear callback/next-step prompt (e.g., “Press 1 for more info, or we’ll text you details.”) — optional in v1.




Logs call SID/status back into the session.




Basic data model


Lead: { id, createdAt, businessName, contactName?, phoneNumber, productCategory, brandName, source }


CallSession: { callId, leadId, phoneNumber, businessName, productCategory, brandName, state: "INTRO"|"DIALING"|"COMPLETED"|"FAILED", transcript: string[], captured: Record<string, string>, providerMeta?: { sid, status } }


Flow


User chats with Lead Gen Bot → submits lead → POST /leads.


Backend creates lead; either:


auto-triggers POST /call/start then POST /call/:callId/dial, or


waits for a manual trigger from a simple admin button.




Dialer places call via Twilio and plays short message; logs Twilio SID/status.


Frontend Status View (tiny admin page) can poll GET /call/:id/status.


Environment variables


TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID


TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN


TWILIO_FROM_NUMBER (verified / trial number)


(Optional) PORT, NODE_ENV


Guardrails & trial-friendly


Trial: must call verified numbers only; handle that gracefully with a helpful error message.


Rate-limit POST /call/start by lead/phone to avoid duplicates.


Validate E.164 phone format.


Non-goals (for now)


No full conversational IVR; just a brief intro message (press-key logic optional).


No complex CRM; in-memory or simple JSON/SQLite is fine.


What to build in Replit


A small TypeScript/Node server exposing the endpoints above.


A simple HTML/JS lead bot (or React mini page) that posts to /leads and shows status.


Twilio helper module that builds TwiML and calls the REST API.


Minimal admin page to list leads and call sessions and trigger “Dial”.


Outcome: a working demo where I can collect a lead with the bot and immediately place an automated intro call to that lead via Twilio, then view the call status in a tiny admin view.
